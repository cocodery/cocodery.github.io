I'm a first-year Computer Science PhD student at the Australian National
University, advised by
[Fabian Muehlboeck](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~fabian.muehlboeck/#about),
[Alex Potanin](https://potanin.github.io/),
and [Antony Hosking](https://hosking.github.io/).

My current research focuses on understanding and improving the performance of
the language runtime, especially for the runtime type check on gradual typing,
and some other programming languages. Besides, I'm also interested in the type
checking and optimizer implementation of JVM, Rust compiler, and LLVM.

Before studying at ANU, I earned my bachelor degree in Computer Science from
Northeastern University in 2023, with the thesis topic
[Compiler Design and Implementation - taking a subset of C as an example](https://github.com/cocodery/c2rvcompiler),
which also won 3rd prize of the National Compiler Competition, under
the supervision of Professor Daling Wang and Dr.Shuai Hou. Then I did research
on operating systems and profiling tools at Fudan University for one year.
